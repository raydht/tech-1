                <h1> I am Nabil, a lifelong Liverpool FC supporter from Indonesia </h1>

                <p> How did I become a Liverpool fan?, It was started from my childhood. 
                    It was kinda dumb and funny actually haha, I knew nothing bout football.
                    It was around 2017-2018 when I really loved to play PES Footbal on my old PlayStation2.
                    I randomly picked a club to play on EPL, and I saw Liverpool, "What a funny bird logo, haha!"
                    then I picked Liverpool because the logo was really laughable back then.
                    I enjoyed playing PES using Liverpool, I was in love with Roberto Firmino's style of play.
                    What a player, what a lovely lad, He's smashing it. He is my favourite football player.
                    Now Liverpool is the club I suppport.

                    <h3>Professional Team Analyst</h3>
                    <p> Do you live, breathe and love Liverpool FC? Kopites does all this and more! We have known disappointment
                        by experiencing the bad times but not loved the club one degree less.
                        A Kopite will spend up to 30 minutes a day, sometimes more, thinking
                        about their club. They will be able to explain to the satisfaction of
                        other fans why they support the club they do and finally they’ll be
                        able to name the entire first team squad and be able to discuss the
                        relative strengths and weaknesses of their team.
                        Of course, it is true that the likes of some of the world’s top clubs get
                        a huge boost in their supporters ranks after some of the success they’ve
                        enjoyed. Just because I didn’t and still don’t live in Liverpool doesn’t make me any less of a Kopite.
                        I still have to explain myself to this day why I support them and not another team. 
                        I may only go to a few games a season, Anfield makes the hair on my neck stand up! 
                        But I still watch every game I possible can, either on TV or the internet. 
                        I Eat, Sleep and Breath Liverpool. I will always be a true Kopite.</p>
